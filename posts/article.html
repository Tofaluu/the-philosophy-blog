            <p>
              &quot;In the judgment of beauty, there are some principles common
              to all men, which, being derived <br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from our nature, may be
              called natural principles of taste.&quot;
            </p>

            <p>
              In this quote from section two of his &quot;An Inquiry Concerning
              Beauty, Order, Harmony,<br />
              and Design,&quot; Hutcheson argues that there are natural
              principles which are shared by all<br />
              humans. And that certain principles of taste underlie our
              judgments of beauty and provide a<br />
              common ground upon which we can base our aesthetic judgments.
            </p>

            <p>
              This idea is part of his larger exploration of the relationship
              between beauty and our<br />
              natural sense of harmony. He argues that harmony is a necessary
              component of beauty, and<br />
              that it is something that is pleasing to all humans. Going into
              greater detail, he believes that<br />
              beauty is a quality that is found in objects that exhibit
              &quot;uniformity amidst variety.&quot; He suggests<br />
              that objects that are too uniform are boring, while objects that
              are too varied are chaotic. So<br />
              instead, beauty is found in objects that strike a balance between
              uniformity and variety.
            </p>

            <p>
              This relates to his broader claims made in sections 1-4 of
              &quot;An Inquiry Concerning Beauty,<br />
              Order, Harmony, and Design.&quot; where he argues that this sense
              of harmony is derived from our<br />
              innate sense of moral goodness and allows us to distinguish
              between good and evil. For<br />
              Hutcheson, beauty, order, harmony, and design are all qualities
              that can be perceived by<br />
              humans through the moral sense. He believes that this sense allows
              us to distinguish between<br />
              beauty and deformity and to appreciate the former.
            </p>

            <p>
              In terms of there being natural principles of taste that guide our
              judgments of beauty.<br />
              An argument can be made that there are certain universal aesthetic
              principles that are shared<br />
              by people from different cultures and backgrounds. For example,
              most people tend to find<br />
              landscapes with rolling hills and winding rivers to be beautiful,
              and the color combination of<br />
              blue and green is generally considered pleasing to the eye. This
              suggests that there may be<br />
              some innate factors that influence our aesthetic preferences.
              However, aesthetic tastes can just<br />
              as easily be shaped by cultural and societal factors. For
              instance, the Japanese aesthetic of<br />
              &quot;wabi-sabi&quot; values imperfection, simplicity, and
              asymmetry, which might not be considered<br />
              conventionally beautiful in other cultures. Another example is
              abstract art, which often lacks a<br />
              clear sense of harmony to be considered beautiful by
              Hutcheson&rsquo;s definitions.
            </p>

            <p>
              And in terms of being a compass for morality, there are probably
              many works of art or<br />
              architecture that are considered beautiful despite being
              associated with things we might<br />
              consider immoral. The Taj Mahal, for instance, is widely admired
              for its beauty, but was said to<br />
              be built as a symbol of Mughal imperialism and forced labor.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our conception of beauty depends on so many factors. Everyone may
              be born with an<br />
              &quot;objective&quot; natural disposition, but things like
              culture, and experiences may eventually shape<br />
              you as much - if not more, than your nature. The memories you've
              created, the sights you long
            </p>

            <p>
              to one day see, imperfections in a work that reminds you of the
              imperfections within yourself.<br />
              Maybe at the end of the day, beauty can simply be described as the
              unique needs of the soul.
