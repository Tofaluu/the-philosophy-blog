              Friedrich Nietzsche's treatment of the subject of knowledge
              demonstrates how necessarily intertwined knowledge is with social
              construct and power. Nietzsche calls into question the concept of
              knowledge as objective, and assumed discovery, advancing the idea
              that knowledge is born when instinct, cultural framework, and
              historical condition complement each other. Nietzsche's views on
              the social dependence of knowledge are critiqued in this essay,
              with a specific focus on his views expressed in
              <em>On the Genealogy of Morality</em>,
              <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, and <em>Beyond Selfless</em>,
              particularly regarding arguments related to power, perspectivism,
              and the effect of historical contexts.
            </p>

            <p>
              For Nietzsche, knowledge is not an impartial hunt for truth but
              rather an instrument deeply incorporated into the forms of power.
              In <em>Genealogy of Morality</em>, he exposes how the ascetic
              ideal controls the production of knowledge and subordinates
              science and philosophy to its metaphysical ends (Nietzsche 87). He
              argues that “...So the scientific truth-ideal is analogous in
              structure to the ideal of the ascetic priest, and is
              psychologically parallel in demanding abstinence and detachment
              from the rest of life…” (Janaway 237) These ideas argue against
              such Enlightenment truths as the notion of universal truth and
              advance the idea that all knowledge is a result of the fights of
              history and society's needs. Nietzsche understands the will to
              truth as part of the will to power. The "truth" upheld by society
              often reflects the interests of the ruling classes, making
              knowledge inherently dependent on the sociopolitical context from
              which it arises.
            </p>

            <p>
              Further, Nietzsche’s theory of perspectivism, denying the
              existence of objects and universal truths, plays a central part in
              his theory. According to Nietzsche in
              <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, 'all truth is interpretations' and
              runs through the perspective of the individuals and groups who
              make them (3). He contends that what is perceived as "truth" is a
              reflection of subjective perspectives shaped by cultural,
              historical, and physiological factors. Nietzsche’s perspectivism
              demonstrates that knowledge is social because how we understand
              knowledge, namely interpretations, is shaped by collective
              experiences and time. This contests the belief that knowledge may
              be isolated from social frameworks. Instead, it shows how various
              interpretations of the role of religion reflect the values and
              norms that are dominant in that society.
            </p>

            <p>
              Also, Nietzsche pays excellent attention to the historical
              contingency of knowledge. He disapproves of the assumption that
              expertise progresses linearly towards increased objectivity.
              However, he interprets it as a cyclic in which power structures
              and cultural value continuously shifts. In
              <em>On the Genealogy of Morality</em>, Nietzsche's account how
              moral concepts have changed historically in response to the
              evolving needs and power relations between societies (Nietzsche
              86). Arguing that moral categories of knowledge are constructed
              and reconstructed through historical interpretation, he shows that
              no category of knowledge remains fixed once it is set loose in the
              social and political practice test market. It also shows that
              knowledge is dependent on society's progress.
            </p>

            <p>
              Lastly, Nietzsche also effected the redefinition of knowledge as a
              creative rather than purely reflective process. In
              <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, he criticizes the standard view of
              what knowledge is and what it relates to, offering instead that it
              is a tool to shape or interpret what existence is (Nietzsche 4).
              Nietzsche can view the role of creativity in knowledge production
              through the role social imagination and cultural aspirations play
              in its creation. This critique of dogmatism and a static
              conception of truth is along these lines. To Nietzsche, knowledge
              is not static but fluid, always envisioned over and over by
              societies to fit their changing needs. Through this reimagining
              process, it becomes apparent that it is socially dependent, as it
              changes with collective learning and goals.
