            <p>
              A radical departure from the traditional imagery of the
              philosopher as merely a critic or sceptic, Friedrich Nietzsche
              suggests the philosopher as the creator of values. According to
              Nietzsche, the philosopher's work is not to believe the current
              truths but to give law to new values to direct humanity's future.
              This essay critically analyses this claim, using one argument to
              support and one to oppose Nietzsche's proposition.
            </p>

            <h3>Argument For: The Philosopher as a Creator of Values</h3>
            <p>
              Nietzsche's interpretation of the philosopher's role defines the
              philosopher as a creator of values, thus situating philosophy as
              an active and transforming force. For Nietzsche, true philosophers
              are "commanders and legislators” not bound by the dogma of
              inherited truths but tasked with creating new paradigms of
              understanding (Nietzsche, <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> 106). In
              this view, philosophy is not, as there has long been a tendency to
              believe, a purely derivative or reflective discipline.
              Philosophers are imagined as great builders of cultural and
              existential meaning, great wielders of what Nietzsche meant by the
              will to power. With the idea of the philosopher's creative agency,
              Nietzsche insists on innovation as a remedy against evolving
              societal and existential challenges. In such a context,
              Nietzsche's model makes the philosopher a necessary progress and
              reform agent. It is also a direct connection of philosophy to life
              and, thus, a practice of vitality and dynamism rather than
              cogitation.
            </p>

            <p>
              What makes this argument strong is an acknowledgment of the
              transformative power of philosophy. Placing philosophers as
              creators who bridge thought with action and keeps philosophy
              related to humanity as long as the philosophers continue to
              create. It is also opposed to the reductive pragmatism of
              positivism, which typically demotes philosophy (logically) lower
              than the empirical sciences. Instead, Nietzsche drills philosophy
              back into the significance of living a life with meaning.
            </p>

            <h3>Argument Against: The Risk of Authoritarianism</h3>
            <p>
              Although Nietzsche’s vision is inspirational, his
              characteristically grandiose approach to an elite intelligence of
              great poets and artists who would make civilization anew is as
              vulnerable to the criticism that it would lead to authoritarianism
              as is the familiar socialist commonwealth of noble minds.
              Nietzsche endangers the philosopher's burden of authority by
              elevating him to the position of legislative power. This leads to
              an issue about subjectivity and fallibility within human nature.
              Nietzsche himself acknowledges that philosophical doctrines often
              stem from personal prejudices, whims, or "fervent wish[es]" masked
              as truths (Nietzsche, <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> 8). The
              problem arises when philosophers are granted the power to impose
              arbitrary or harmfully rigid systems in the name of innovation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, this approach cuts against philosophy's collaborative
              and communal nature. Wilhelm Dilthey’s critique offers a
              counterpoint, emphasizing that philosophy gains legitimacy through
              its capacity to unify diverse worldviews and to ground itself in a
              "universally valid worldview" (Dilthey,
              <em>The Essence of Philosophy</em> 239). While Nietzsche’s model
              might leave us isolated from one another, and only connected
              through self as the fundamental reality, Dilthey finds philosophy
              within the continued human communal enterprise of leading
              meaningful lives with a communal dream to make things better. By
              taking this collaborative approach to exploring philosophical
              insights and sharing the validation for their existence, this
              framework reduces the risk of ideological extremism replacing
              philosophical insights.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              An inspiring vision of what philosophy might be able to do,
              Nietzsche presents his definition of the philosopher's task —
              creator of values. This leads to the transformative nature of
              philosophy and the fact that it can help us break into uncharted
              territories. The model, though, is not without risk. Nietzsche’s
              framework, wherein individual will is over communal dialogue, can
              prove to be used to abuse power. It is possible that both tasks of
              the philosopher are necessary, and priority shifts depending on
              the conditions of the philosophers. Being patrons of communal
              ideals when conditions allow and a creator of values when a rapid
              transformation is necessary.
