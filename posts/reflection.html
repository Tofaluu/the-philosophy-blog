            <p>
              &quot;So we can’t say of any being that it is wholly and
              absolutely bad unless we can show for certain that what we are
              calling bad isn’t also good in some other system or in relation to
              some other order or economy.&quot;
            </p>

            <p>
              In the passage above located in Book 1 of &quot;An Inquiry
              Concerning Virtue and Merit;&quot; Shaftesbury is suggesting that
              moral judgments of good or bad cannot be made in isolation from
              external factors. And that the context or system in which an
              action or a being exists in must be taken into consideration.
            </p>

            <p>
              The purpose of this quote is to highlight the importance of
              perspective when evaluating an action or being as moral. For
              example, consider a predator who kills its prey for survival.
              While this act may seem ‘bad’ for the prey, it is necessary for
              the predator&#39;s survival and therefore can be seen as
              &quot;good&quot; in the larger system of the ecosystem. In such a
              case, what is ‘good&#39; in one context may not be so in another.
              Shaftesbury argues that the only way to label a being as “wholly
              and absolutely bad” requires an understanding of its role within
              every system that it affects, and a demonstration that its actions
              are not &#39;good&#39; in any context.
            </p>

            <p>
              Shaftesbury&#39;s presents these ideas as the foundation to
              support his overarching argument in &quot;An Inquiry Concerning
              Virtue and Merit.&quot; In this work, he posits that virtue and
              moral behavior are essential to the well-being of society and the
              individual. Every individual being possesses a natural “good” or
              desire; and acting purely in the pursuit of those individual
              desires is what he calls selfishness. Virtue, however, is acting
              beyond our self-interest in service of the larger society (or
              system) with which we belong. For Shaftesbury, it is only through
              the cultivation of virtue and moral behavior that individuals can
              achieve true happiness and fulfillment.
            </p>

            <p>
              I found Shaftesbury&#39;s quote particularly relevant especially
              in relation to some of our recent discussions regarding the
              truckers and mask/vaccine mandates. The quote helps explain the
              conflicts that arise when different people and citizens all act in
              service of their self-interest or the interests of the specific
              systems they are concerned with. For instance, the purpose of the
              government is to make decisions in service of the whole of the
              country (of course this is not always the case). Something like a
              vaccine mandate provides an overall good towards the “system” of
              Canada. However, it can also have a negative impact on other
              private systems - such as the community of truckers - who are
              concerned with their individual rights or the safety of their
              loved ones. It is from this perspective that neither groups can be
              said to be “wholly” good or bad.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, Shaftesbury&#39;s quote highlights the importance
              of understanding different systems and economies in making moral
              assessments. It is a reminder that what may be considered bad in
              one context may be seen as good in another. In the contemporary
              context, this quote serves as a call for individuals to consider
              the broader context in which actions take place before making
              moral judgments. This is particularly relevant in today&#39;s
              political climate, where the interests of different socio-economic
              classes often come into conflict.
