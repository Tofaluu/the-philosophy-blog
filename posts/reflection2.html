            <p>
              In the seventh thesis of his essay
              <em>“Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of View”</em>,
              Kant argues it is inevitable that the different fractured nations
              of the world will eventually unite into a “league of nations”. I
              won’t go too into detail regarding his arguments, but in short,
              his reasoning is that, just as each individual human benefits from
              entering into a society to ensure collective safety, the same
              logic holds when applied at scale. So if we consider each nation
              as an individual person, it is for each nation’s collective
              benefit to act co-operatively rather than against each other.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, he elaborates on this and says that the
              natural/instinctive way humanity arrives at such contracts of
              peace has always been out of necessity rather than reason –
              despite the fact that reason alone should theoretically be enough
              to bring the world to peace. In other words, humans have a habit
              of doing everything the hard way and are unwilling to make the
              necessary changes until forced to through pain and conflict.
            </p>

            <p>
              Although Kant was referring to global peace, I felt this analysis
              of humanity’s nature at approaching problems could just as easily
              be applied to the issue of climate change. Despite reason and
              science telling us far in advance the very real and inevitable
              consequences of climate change, humans seem to have a super-power
              for ignoring long-term problems in favor of protecting a more
              comfortable world view.
            </p>

            <p>
              His solution for this is “long internal working of each political
              body toward the education of its citizens” – specifically an
              education towards a stronger moral disposition. I do believe the
              current generation of young minds are at a point where they are
              becoming more and more concerned with the issues plaguing us with
              climate change. Yet, it still seems to be out of necessity of the
              imminent threat rather than as a result of reason and higher
              education.
            </p>

            <p>
              In a way, I have no doubt that every generation has had their fair
              share of imminent threats that forced change (except maybe those
              hippies in the 60s and 70s). But it seems to me that, to truly act
              in a way that minimizes collective human suffering – each
              generation would have to not only work to solve the problems of
              their time; but also selflessly, out of moral obligation, work to
              predict and prevent the problems of subsequent generations as
              well.
