            <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

            <p>
              As artificial intelligence continues to advance, the ethical
              alignment of AI has become an increasingly important concern.
              Ensuring that these systems understand and adhere to human values
              is vital to minimizing the potential harm while maximizing the
              benefits that AI can offer society. This essay aims to explore the
              educational philosophies of John Locke and Michel de Montaigne and
              discuss how their ideas on education can contribute to the
              discussion of ethical alignment of AI. I will accomplish this by:
              (1) Provide a brief summary regarding AI alignment; (2) discuss
              Locke's key ideas on education in the context of AI alignment; (3)
              discuss Montaigne's key ideas on education in the context of AI
              alignment; (4) provide a personal analysis of which I believe to
              be the more suitable approach; (5) summarize my findings in a
              conclusion.

            <h3><strong>(1) Brief Intro to AI Alignment</strong></h3>

            <p>
              AI alignment is a field of research dedicated to the development
              of AIs that are safe, controllable, and beneficial to humanity.
              Solving the issue of AI alignment is essential because as AI
              become increasingly more autonomous and powerful, systems not
              properly aligned with human values, might inadvertently cause harm
              or act in ways that conflict with our ethical norms and
              expectations.

            </h3>

            <p>
              In his work "Some Thoughts Concerning Education," John Locke
              emphasizes the importance of instilling virtue and moral values in
              children through education. His approach to education advocates
              for a structured and guided style of learning, focusing on
              habituation and the provision of healthy role models for
              imitation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Locke believes that ingraining good habits early in life is
              essential for cultivating virtue. "Virtue is harder to be got than
              a knowledge of the world; and, if lost in a young man, is seldom
              recovered." (Locke, Some Thoughts Concerning Education) He argues
              that the development of these qualities should be prioritized over
              the mere acquisition of knowledge or skills, as a person with a
              virtuous character is more likely to use their knowledge and
              abilities responsibly and ethically. He believes this can be done
              through exercising a certain level of control over a child's
              learning environment until such time the child is properly
              “fortified” against vice and corruption. “A young man, before he
              leaves the shelter of his father's house, and the guard of a
              tutor, should be fortified with resolution, and made acquainted
              with men, to secure his virtue; lest he should be led into some
              ruinous course, or fatal precipice.” (Locke)
            </p>

            <p>
              In the context of AI alignment, Locke's ideas would suggest a more
              rigid and controlled approach for instilling behavior in AI. This
              approach is already the default when training specialized AI
              systems such as AlphaGo (An AI specialized for the board game
              “Go”). The emphasis on specialization allows AI to be extremely
              adept at accomplishing a specific task. However, if the parameters
              are too rigid, this may also risk stifling creativity and
              innovation, potentially limiting an AI's ability to assist in
              solving novel challenges.
            </p>

            <h3>
              <strong
                >(3) Montaigne's Ideas on Education applied to AI
                Alignment</strong
              >
            </h3>

            <p>
              In Book 1 of his "Essays", Michel de Montaigne offers an opposing
              perspective on education compared to that of Locke's. While he
              shares Locke's beliefs in the importance of instilling virtue and
              sound judgment, Montaigne's educational philosophy leans more
              towards self-discovery and learning through experience. His
              philosophy also differs in the degree to which teachers should
              control the information presented to a child. He highlights the
              value of having fresh eyes in education, arguing that students
              should not be overly constrained by pre-existing norms. For
              Montaigne, teachers should act as guides and facilitators whose
              job is to encourage students to independently explore, question,
              and reflect on their learning. And should take extra care not to
              provide too much support, as this deprives the students of deep
              understanding and innovation. “It is good to make him trot in
              front of his tutor, letting the latter judge the child's pace and
              judge how far he has to hold back to adapt himself to the child's
              ability.” (Montaigne, Essays, Book I)
            </p>

            <p>
              In other words, Montaigne believes that a well-rounded education
              should not only provide students with information, but foster
              their ability to make sound decisions and solve problems in the
              real world - along with all its novel complexities. "Let him be
              made to show what he has just learned in a hundred aspects and
              apply it to that many different subjects, to see whether he has
              really grasped it and made it his own.” (Montaigne)
            </p>

            <p>
              In the context of AI alignment, Montaigne's focus on
              self-discovery, learning through experience, and the value of
              fresh eyes encourages the development of AI that can think
              critically and innovate in the face of complex ethical dilemmas.
              In other words, by not constraining AI to a narrow set of
              experiences, we encourage the development of AI that are able to
              better navigate the nuances of human values as well as handle
              complex real-world dilemmas.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, this approach, in turn, carries the risk of allowing AI
              to develop misaligned understandings of human values, which could
              result in dire unintended negative consequences. This is already
              an issue when considering AI systems like self-driving cars, where
              there are already numerous ethical debates, such as whether an AI
              should prioritize the safety of the driver or a pedestrian in
              zero-sum scenarios.

                Approaches</strong
              >
            </h3>

            <p>
              In applying the educational philosophies of Locke and Montaigne to
              the ethical alignment of AI, both approaches offer subtly distinct
              benefits and limitations. However, when it comes to discerning
              which approach is best, I would argue that Locke's approach is
              more fitting for the short-term. My reasoning being that, despite
              some similarities, AI systems of course differ from children in
              several significant ways - one of the most crucial being the rapid
              pace at which AI can advance. “'tis, as in the fountains of some
              rivers where a gentle application of the hand turns the flexible
              waters into channels, that make them take quite contrary courses,
              and by this little direction given them at first in the source
              they receive different tendencies and arrive at last at very
              remote and distant places.” (Locke)
            </p>

            <p>
              This quote by Locke emphasizes how the most minute changes in
              direction early on in a child's education can lead to vastly
              different outcomes. Yet, no matter how brilliant a child may be,
              their learning is still limited to the natural biological speed of
              a human being - a speed which allows for gentle corrections and is
              more forgiving of detours. However, a misaligned AI in that same
              time, can travel dangerously far in the wrong direction.
            </p>

            <p>
              To illustrate this, imagine a child as a canoe and an AI as a
              speed boat, both with the intention of travelling straight across
              the water from point A to point B (point B being a proper
              education of ethics). It takes an hour for the canoe to arrive
              whereas the speedboat would only take five minutes. If both leave
              point A just slightly askew, after 10 minutes, the canoe can still
              easily re-adjust back onto course; however, the speed boat would
              have already shot past twice the intended distance. This becomes
              even more complex when we consider humanity as a whole still has
              not even come to a clear consensus of where point B (our ethical
              values) even lies. A simple example being the trolley problem
              applied to self-driving cars and whether they should be programmed
              to prioritize passengers or pedestrians. The slightest lack of
              nuance when providing training could result in a car driving into
              a building simply because it is programmed to avoid pedestrians at
              all costs.
            </p>

            <p>
              So, although Montaigne's approach of fostering independent
              exploration and decision making is great for innovation; I believe
              when it comes to AI, the potential harm that could result from a
              misaligned training program is significantly greater than that of
              a misguided child. And that Locke's approach to allowing
              exploration in a tightly controlled environment is a necessary
              precaution when considering the consequences of failure.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>

            <p>
              The educational philosophies of John Locke and Michel de Montaigne
              offer valuable insights into the ethical alignment of AI. Locke's
              structured and guided approach to education proves more fitting
              for the short-term, ensuring that AI systems adhere to human
              values and remain controllable. Alternatively, Montaigne's
              emphasis on self-discovery and critical thinking serves as an
              important long-term goal for AI to be truly beneficial to
              humanity, fostering innovation and problem-solving capabilities.
            </p>

            <p>
              When considering the unique challenges in educating AI systems
              when compared to human children, the rapid rate at which AI learns
              and develops necessitates a greater degree of caution when
              considering the potential harm. This challenge is further
              complicated by the ongoing struggle within humanity to even define
              its own ethical values. Therefore, it is crucial for us to find a
              balance between Locke and Montaigne's differing approaches while
              continually advancing our understanding of ethics. Successfully
              overcoming these challenges allows us to achieve AI systems that
              are not only aligned with human values, but also capable of
              innovating and solving complex ethical dilemmas.
