              The Main Difference between Human and Natural Sciences According

            <p>
              Wilhelm Dilthey was a famous German philosopher who made the most
              renowned distinction between human sciences
              (<em>Geisteswissenschaften</em>) and natural sciences
              (<em>Naturwissenschaften</em>). Most of his work involves the
              distinction in terms of the goal, method, and the like in these
              two fields from epistemological and methodological points of view.
              This essay critically explores Dilthey's distinction between human
              and natural sciences as it appears in his philosophical writings.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, the most apparent divergence is in what these sciences aim
              to accomplish. According to Dilthey, natural sciences explain
              phenomena through 'causality' and 'general laws.' They aim to
              reveal objective facts about the external world by employing
              rigorous observation methods, measurement, and prediction of a
              natural occurrence (Dilthey,
              <em>The Formation of the Historical World</em> 104). On the other
              hand, the human sciences attempt to comprehend human experiences
              in a subjective and context-based manner. Dilthey suggests that
              human sciences deduce meanings from historical, cultural, and
              social phenomena. This includes empathetically accessing the lived
              experience of persons and communities, which he refers to as
              <strong>Verstehen</strong> (understanding). Whereas natural
              sciences offer universalization in their universalizing
              tendencies, human sciences place their emphasis on particularity
              and individuality as a result of human existence's diversity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Also significantly different is methodology. Natural science does
              not rest on metaphysical assumptions; it depends on empirical
              observation, experimentation, and quantification to yield
              objective and reproducible results. Striving mainly to establish
              causality and formulation of the laws of natural phenomena
              (Dilthey, <em>The Formation of the Historical World</em> 104-107).
              However, the human sciences are primarily founded upon
              hermeneutics, or the art of interpretation. According to Dilthey,
              <em>The Formation of the Historical World</em>, empirical methods
              cannot exhaust human experiences because they are historically,
              culturally, and socially determined (106). In this sense,
              hermeneutics translates texts, symbols, and actions, understanding
              that insider meanings are constructed depending on the
              presumptions of internal meaning and that these presumptions are
              determined by those producing the meaning. As a result, the human
              sciences are necessarily interpretive, not explanatory.
            </p>

            <p>
              Additionally, subjectivity becomes central, argues Dilthey, in the
              human sciences. Subjectivity is removed in the natural sciences to
              ensure objectivity and reproducibility. Subjectivity is not a
              limitation in the human sciences but rather is the very thing that
              needs to be understood. According to Dilthey,
              <em>The Formation of the Historical World</em>, only if we concede
              the subjective viewpoints of individuals and their historical
              situation will we be able to understand human experiences (102).
              Natural sciences aim for universal truths that stand above
              personal points of view; human sciences embrace the variability
              and relativity of human beings. But for Dilthey, this does not
              reduce the validity of human sciences; it characterizes their
              subject matter's richness and intricate character.
            </p>

            <p>
              Further, central to Diltheyâ€™s philosophy is the contextual
              dependency of the human sciences. Dilthey,
              <em>The Formation of the Historical World</em> claims that the
              actions and expressions of a man are temporal and historical
              (102-107). Thus, they are dynamic and develop, unlike the natural
              sciences, which are, after time, independent truths and laws that
              remain the same forever. The human sciences, therefore, demand
              consciousness of history's continuity and change. Situating a
              historical text within its specific cultural and temporal context
              is essential to comprehend that text, but it is alien to the
              methodologies of the natural sciences.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hence, Dilthey maintains that the difference between the human and
              natural sciences is found in their objectives, methods, and
              epistemological assumptions. Whereas natural sciences attempt to
              explain natural phenomena by authority of empirical observation
              and [by authority of] causality, the human sciences seek to
              explain human experiences by interpretation and empathy. This
              distinction identifies the particular contribution of each field
              to our understanding of reality and their variety of approaches to
              knowledge and knowledge validation.
