              In <i>Physics - Book II</i>, Aristotle offers an explication on
              his understanding of the terms "luck" and "chance" as well as
              their distinctions. Upon analysis, I believe Aristotle fails to
              clearly elaborate on an example where his definition for chance
              and luck seem to contradict. The purpose of this essay is to
              identify the supposed contradiction, then offer a method of
              interpreting it that dispels said contradiction. I will do this
              by: first, providing some context for how I will be referring to
              the terms chance and luck in the essay; second, briefly
              summarizing Aristotle's conditions for when an event is considered
              luck and when it is chance; third, identifying and explaining the
              contradiction in Aristotle's example; fourth, address a potential
              objection to my interpretation; and finally, summarize my findings
              in a conclusion.
            </p>

            <p>
              Before we begin, it is important to note that Aristotle views
              "luck" as a sub-category of "chance"; meaning all luck is chance,
              but not all chance is luck (197b1-5). This can become confusing
              quite quickly so for the sake of clarity, I will refer to
              instances where "chance" includes luck as "chance/luck", and
              instances where "chance" does not include luck as just "chance"
              (this does not pertain to direct quotes).
            </p>

            <p>
              Luck and chance are a type of "cause" used to describe or explain
              events that: neither necessarily nor usually occurs; and also
              results from an action not intended for said event (196b20). An
              example of this similar to the one given by Aristotle (196b30-35)
              is as follows: a man decides to visit his local bathhouse
              (somewhere he does not usually nor needs to visit). It just so
              happens that someone who owes him money ends up also going that
              day and is able to repay him. Because the man did not intend to
              collect the money by visiting the bathhouse, luck could be said to
              be the cause of this occurring.
            </p>

            <p>
              From there, the difference between chance and luck is that luck
              only pertains to events that result from the actions and decisions
              of rational agents (adult humans), whereas chance can pertain to
              any action in nature (children, animals, objects) (197b15-20). An
              example of chance given by Aristotle is that of a chair falling:
              "...it did not fall in order to be sat on, although it was left
              standing in order to be sat on" (197b15). His reasoning here is
              that a chair falling is an usual and unnecessary event that also
              goes against its purpose - which is to be sat on. And this cannot
              be an example of luck because there was no rational decision
              involved in its actions making it an example of chance.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now that weâ€™ve established that, the following example is where I
              believe there is a potential contradiction between his definition
              of chance and his conditions for luck: "For the stone did not fall
              in order to hit someone; it fell by chance, because it might have
              fallen because someone threw it to hit someone." (197b30) The
              example comes at the end of a paragraph where Aristotle provides a
              concrete distinction between when something is chance versus when
              it is luck (197b20). Making it reasonable to assume that the
              purpose of the example is to illustrate this distinction. His
              argument here seems to be that; because the stone is not a
              rational agent capable of making decisions, the results of its
              actions cannot be luck and therefore is an example of only chance.
              It is clear that the focus of Aristotle's point is on the
              intentions (or lack thereof) of the stone. However, it appears to
              me that this could be viewed instead as an event of luck. This is
              apparent if you shift the perspective to that of the "someone"
              being hit by the stone. For it must have been a result of some
              decision made by the rational agent that led them to the unlucky
              event of them being hit by the stone.
            </p>

            <p>
              I argue the best way to interpret this seeming contradiction is to
              suggest that an event or result can be interpreted as either
              chance or luck, relative to the perspective. And this in turn, is
              done by considering certain events as a composite of smaller
              events. For example: let us say a bird happened to knock a stone
              off a roof. At that same moment, a man who had just decided on a
              whim to visit the bathhouse walks by and is hit by the stone. In
              this example, I argue there are in fact three distinct events: (1)
              the bird knocking the pebble off the roof; (2) the man deciding
              the visit the bathhouse, and (3) the man being hit by the pebble.
            </p>

            <p>
              In such a case, event (1) is a chance event, since animals are
              incapable of causing events of luck. Event (2) is a neutral event
              involving a rational agent and is neither chance nor luck.
              However, when the rational agent in (2) encounters the cause of
              chance in (1), a third event of luck is produced - the result
              being event (3). In other words, a chance event can also be the
              cause of a separate luck event by encountering the actions of a
              rational agent.
            </p>

            <p>
              Based on this conclusion, if we go back to Aristotle's example of
              the stone falling. We could argue that the isolated event of the
              stone falling was indeed a result of chance and not luck - as any
              events that may have followed were irrelevant to how we define
              that initial event. (This of course would not be true if instead a
              rational agent had accidentally hit the stone, in which case both
              the stone falling and the stone hitting someone would both be luck
              events).
            </p>

            <p>
              An objection to my interpretation of the passage could be that the
              purpose of the stone example was not to illustrate the distinction
              between chance and luck but was instead a further illustration of
              chance/luck versus an event that was neither. This is supported by
              the latter part of his example where he writes "it might have
              fallen because someone threw it" which is clearly an example of
              neither chance nor luck (187b30). I accept that this is a
              possibility, but I believe this has little effect on my
              conclusions, as my criticism of Aristotle stems from his lack of
              elaboration on the situation I presented rather than the
              overarching purpose of that one example.
            </p>

            <p>
              In <i>Physics - Book II</i>, Aristotle provides an example of a
              stone falling and hitting someone to illustrate a situation when
              chance is not luck. At first glance, this example seems to
              contradict his definition of luck, as it involves a rational
              agent. However, by interpreting the example as containing multiple
              distinct events rather than one singular event, I've concluded
              that it is possible for Aristotle's example to be one of only
              chance despite the presence of a rational agent. Furthermore,
              though I concede that there is an alternative way to view the
              original purpose of the example, I believe this does not change
              the validity of my conclusion. This is because the potential for
              the contradiction to exist would remain whether or not Aristotle
              had addressed it directly himself.
