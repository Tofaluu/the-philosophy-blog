                        <p>Spirited Away, directed by Hayao Miyazaki, is a gorgeous, breathtaking adventure movie with a touching story. When it was released in 2001, it was highly praised for its incredible animation, amazing score, and well-implemented elements of Japanese-folklore, leaving it with awards such as an Oscar for Best Animated Feature, and many more. However, what resonates the most with audiences is its messages and themes spread throughout the film. Spirited Away talks a lot about capitalism and its unfairness, as well alienation from what is reality. The struggles that are caused by these things are quite extreme, especially for the lower classes who are forced to contend with them. These Marxist concepts turn this film from what is a beautiful experience with a heartwarming but melancholy story, into something that connects deeply with many people in ways that aren&rsquo;t noticeable on the surface.</p>

<p> The story follows a ten-year-old girl named Chihiro, who is on her way to her new home with her parents when they stumble upon an abandoned amusement park. After walking around, they find some delicious food lying around, and her parents don&rsquo;t hesitate to munch away. This turns them into pigs, and Chihiro is then transported into a magical world of the gods and spirits, with her main goal being to turn her parents back to normal.</p>

<p> Right off the bat, the consequences of capitalism are demonstrated. Chihiro&rsquo;s parents secretly devour the food lying around without telling anyone, turning them into pigs. At first view, this seems to be caused by the spirits who live here, and while true, it also has a deeper meaning. This outcome represents the greed that leads capitalists to eventually turn less and less human, and in this case, more and more like a pig who constantly wants to keep eating. Once they let their greed overtake them, they lose who they are on the inside. It is almost like a disease, eating away one&rsquo;s self as they eat from others.</p>

<p> Chihiro is quite the opposite of her parents, as her story demonstrates being on the other side of capitalism and alienation. When she enters the magical world for the first time, she already gains a sense of alienation. Nothing seems natural to her, and this translates to when she finally gets a job at a bathhouse. Chihiro, as a worker, feels foreign to the products of her own labor, as she&rsquo;s really just following everyone around, not doing anything on her terms. In this world, humans are seen as filthy garbage who are not supposed to be here, so this causes Chihiro to feel isolated from the others. Luckily, she gets some help from others, but even then, nothing makes much sense to her and she just works to live.</p>

<p> Chihiro experiences the consequences of capitalism in other ways as well, even to a harsher degree. In this magical world, Chihiro does not work to make money, she works to survive. She does not have human rights because there are no other humans but her, so to not be turned into an animal, and to be recognized as valuable, Chihiro has to go through very hard labour. This situation reflects critical concepts surrounding capitalism, because it represents how those without institutional wealth have to work extra hard to gain any type of respect, even just enough respect to survive and not be considered a lower form of life.</p>

<p> At the end of the film, Chihiro is given a final test to save her parents. She is presented with around a dozen pigs, and is asked to say which one is her parents. After a while, she realizes that none of them are her parents, and with that as her final answer, she passes the test and everything is back to normal again. The reason why she knows none of them are her parents is because Haku, a helpful companion of Chihiro in the spirit world, tells Chihiro not to forget what her parents look like. Chihiro is the only one who truly knows her parents. Everybody else sees them as greedy capitalists, but Chihiro sees them as good parents who made a big mistake. In her mind, they are not pigs, and by being the only one who knows this, she saves them by letting the others know the truth as well.</p>

<p> Spirited Away brilliantly uses Marxist concepts to carry its simplistic, but interesting story, and push it to a level that is often not present in films. From the parents&rsquo; example of capitalists and Chihiro&rsquo;s experience on the other side of capitalism, to Chihiro&rsquo;s alienation when it comes to her work and her eventually success in bringing her parents back, all of these along with the film&rsquo;s beautiful storytelling and visuals gives an experience and teaches lessons that can last a lifetime. Even as a film from twenty years ago, there are a lot of messages and themes that can be applied to humans today, and humans many years to come.<br>
